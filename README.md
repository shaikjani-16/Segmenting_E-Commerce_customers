**Segmenting E-Commerce customers based on their purchase patterns**

**Data Collection**: Gathered customer transaction data from your e-commerce platform, including customer ID, purchase history, order details, timestamps, and other relevant data points.

**Data Preprocessing**: Preprocessed the collected data by handling missing values, removing outliers, and ensuring data integrity. Transformed the data into a suitable format for segmentation analysis.

**Defining Segmentation Variables**: Identify key variables that can be used to segment customers based on their purchase patterns. These variables include frequency (number of purchases), recency (time since last purchase), monetary value (total spending), average order value, purchase categories, or any other relevant metrics that capture customer behavior.

**Feature Engineering**: Calculated derived features from the raw data that can provide deeper insights into customer behavior. For example, compute metrics such as total spending in different product categories, average time between purchases, or customer lifetime value.

**Data Normalization**: Normalized the segmentation variables to ensure they are on a comparable scale. This step is important, especially when using algorithms that are sensitive to the relative magnitudes of variables **(Standard Scalar)**.
 
**Select Segmentation Algorithm**: Commonly used algorithms include k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, or Gaussian mixture models.

**Determine Optimal Number of Segments**: Elbow method.

**Perform Segmentation**: Apply the selected segmentation algorithm to group customers into segments based on their purchase patterns. Assign each customer to a segment based on their similarity in terms of the segmentation variables.
